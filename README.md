# Phishing-Link-Scanner
Phishing-Link-Scanner is a proactive security tool that protects users from social engineering. Instead of a hardware firewall, it uses a Python-based analysis engine to scrape URLs, check SSL certificate validity, and identify domain-spoofing techniques (like "homograph attacks") to calculate a "Risk Score" for any suspicious link.
